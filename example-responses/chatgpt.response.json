However, as the day progresses, the cloud coverage will increase, which might lead to locally heavy rains and rare thunderstorms. Additionally, a weak to moderate wind will blow in from the southeast direction, and due to the Povardarieto, it might intensify at times.\n\nIf you're in Skopje, expect similar weather with a sunny, yet moderately cloudy sky and a weak to moderate wind blowing from the southeast. With the sun shining bright, it is an excellent day to go out and enjoy the weather, be it for a picnic or a stroll in the park. \n\nAs always, it's essential to stay updated on the weather conditions and take the necessary precautions to stay safe in case of sudden changes."
